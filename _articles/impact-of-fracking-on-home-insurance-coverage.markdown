The increase in seismic risk in these areas usually underscores the need for homeowners to consider purchasing earthquake insurance that covers damage from induced earthquakes. However, some earthquake policies carve out coverage for earthquakes not naturally occurring, such as earthquakes attributed to waste water injection from hydraulic fracturing activities. Furthermore, many policies have anti-concurrent causation provisions excluding coverage for damage if both a covered and uncovered peril occur, regardless of whether the predominate cause of the loss was a covered loss. This could mean insurers may deny losses for covered perils, such as a fire, if the fire resulted from an uncovered peril, such as an induced earthquake.
