The Anadarko Petroleum Corporation oil well that blew out of control northeast of Denver near Hudson, forcing closure of Weld County roads for two days, sprayed at least 28,000 gallons of oil, gas and drilling waste water onto surrounding land before fluids were re-directed into tanks, state officials said Wednesday.
